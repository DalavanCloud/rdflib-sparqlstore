v0.2 2012/10/10
	* Renamed SPARQLStore package to lowercase.
	* SPARQLStore object is now directly importable:
	  from rdflib_sparqlstore import SPARQLStore

	* Made SPARQLStore return real rdflib.query.Result objects
	  * This means any Query returning only a single variable will still
	    return a tuple
	  * Any registered Result serializer can now be used
	  * serialize(format='python') is not longer required (or supported)

	* Fixed context-awareness.
	* Fixed SPARQL Update deletes with variables

	* Made compatible with SPARQLWrapper 1.5.1
